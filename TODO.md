# FlakeMonster Website TODO

Static demo site, works locally via `file://` or hosted on a CDN. All vanilla JS, no build step.

## List
- [ ] **design** more detail using svg images to the hero and throughout the pages, monster world themed.
- [ ] **wiggle** the moster at hero-logo adding playfullness to the site.
- [ ] **make** a new section for planned features like: add more language support.
- [ ] **Seed Explorer** really small text, a bit too small and the pause play button is too small and too hard to see.
- [ ] **footer-wave** should be a wave animation, what you have is a good starting point, we need to to have more detail and be longer and loop so it looks like constant waves. have each layer moving at a different speed. try to do this entirely with svgs and css.

## Questions
- [ ] Should I not just be monitizing on `GitHub Action`? Can I paywall it or is that bad idea from a community and growth perspective.
